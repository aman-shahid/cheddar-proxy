# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please use GitHub Security Advisories (Security tab → “Report a vulnerability”) and include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and any proof of concept.
- Do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities. Give us time to investigate and patch.
- You should receive an acknowledgment within 72 hours. We aim to provide a status update within 7 days and coordinate a disclosure timeline once a fix is ready.

## Scope

- Supported platforms: macOS and Windows builds produced from this repository.
- Out of scope: vulnerabilities that require rooted/jailbroken devices, user-installed malware, or unsupported forks.

## Guidelines for Researchers

- Test on your own machines and traffic; do not target third-party services or users without permission.
- Do not access, modify, or delete data that is not yours.
- Avoid denial-of-service or availability-impacting tests.
- Do not attempt social engineering or phishing.

## Credits

We appreciate responsible disclosure and are happy to credit researchers in release notes unless anonymity is requested.
